#Backgammon
This project is a students Project for the lecture Softwareengineering at the University of Applied Science Konstanz.
The main aim of the Project was to implement a game, by taking care of using several techniques of software developement.
Therefore we had to learn and implement severals things:

* Version Controll
* test driven development
* layered Architecture (Model-View-Controler)
* take care of source metrics with sonar
* continues integration with gradle and jenkins
* implementation of several patterns
* build components and use Interfaces

There are two user interfaces which can be used in parallel. Obviously a user will prefer to use the gui to play Backgammon, however its also 
possible to play Backgammon also with the tui. The Tui is implented as an Logging mechanism.
